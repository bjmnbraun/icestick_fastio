# icestick_fastio
Fast I/O to icestick 

Title: Icestick Fast IO
Team Members: Benjamin Braun, Nate Chizgi
Goal of the project: Efficient streaming to/from icestick for image processing 
Deliverables: Demonstration of streaming image with basic processing (blur, color transform, etc)
Interesting Challenge Solved: Given cheap off the shelf device, what is the fastest streaming interface we can achieve.  
Previous work in this area: UART RX example given in class.  Ross demonstrated real time edge detection in class.  Streaming IO available through SRAM on icestick with some modification to the device.  
Resources to draw upon
