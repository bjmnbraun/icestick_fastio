This directory should contain some python module that, when used alongside
generating an FPGA layout, will:
  - emit additional circuitry needed to implement some desired I/O on the
    FPGA
  - emit a file ".iospec" which can be used to build and/or run an I/O program
    on the CPU that interfaces with the FPGA and does something

For example, a call to something like

  - fastio_display(width, height, framerate, details)

  where details is optional and provides fields such as
    - pixel format (RGB8, RGB4, RGBA8, etc.)
    - etc.
    (these should all have some reasonable defaults)

  The call will generate a circuit that talks to some UART. The circuit has some inputs
  that need to be wired up to other FPGA components to provide the actual
  pixels that are then displayed.

  It also outputs an iospec
  file conaining a single line:

  display 640 480 <fields in details> <some port information>

  the iospec can be passed to the io_display program to build and /or run a
  program that will display the data produced on the FPGA.
